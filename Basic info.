Here I will give you basic info about technique which is very important for creation of Machine learning models

As we know that there are 2 type of data:
1) Numerical data
2) categorical data

Numerical data means columns which has pure numbers. examples include weight , height , salary etc
Categorical data means columns which creates division amonng data , most of the times these are non numerica data
examples include gender , address , favourite food , political party you voted for etc.

Categorical data do not needs to be altered while performing data analysis as BI tools like power bi or Tableau
can handle it preety well , but when we try to use that data in machine learning algorithms, it creates problem
as ML algorithms can only understand numbers and not string

so fine then , we can replace replace genders with 0 and 1 for male and female. but that too will not work
as replaceing "male" and "female" with 0 and 1 will create errord in ML algorithms as 1 is greater tha 0 means females 
are superior than male, which is absolutely not that case. In the context of database we are trating both genders as same.
by the way replacing categorical columns with 0/1 would have worked in case of reviews columns
i.e. replacing excellent with 1 and bad with 0 as their is inherent hierarchy in review column data

so here we will have to do something else, for using dataset with categorical columns for ML algo.
and hence One Hot Encoding method coms to play.

direct implementation of one hot encoding is in next script of same repo.
